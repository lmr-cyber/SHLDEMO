## Question

A company is planning a big sale at which they will give their customers a special promotional discount. Each customer that purchases a product from the company has a unique customerID numbered from 0 to N-1. 
Andy, the marketing head of the company, has selected bill amounts of the N customers for the promotional scheme. The discount will be given to the customers whose bill amounts are perfect squares. 
The customers may use this discount on a future purchase.
Write an algorithm to help Andy find the number of customers that will be given discounts.

### Input
- The first line of the input consists of an integer numOfCust, representing the number of customers whose bills are selected for the promotional discount (N).
- The second line consists of N space-separated integers - bill(0) bill(1).... bill(N-1), representing the bill amounts of the N customers selected for the promotional discount.

### Output
Print an integer representing the number of customers that will be given discounts.

### Constraints
0 ≤ numOfCust ≤ 10^6
0 ≤ bill(i) ≤ 10^6
0 ≤ i < numOfCust

### Example
```
Input:
